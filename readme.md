  <h3 align="center">2D Motion Capture for Digital Animation</h3>
</div>

## About The Project
Developed a 2D motion capture and animation system that translates real-world movements from a physical puppet into digital character animations. Utilized computer vision techniques to track motion markers, extract movement data, and process it for application to 2D assets. Designed a mapping system to apply captured motion to a rigged character, enabling realistic articulation of sprite-based animations.
